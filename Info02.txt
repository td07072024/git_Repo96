The Brahmaputra-Jamuna is a classic example of a braided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion.[1] It is characterised by a network of interlacing channels with numerous sandbars enclosed between them. The sandbars, known in Bengali as chars, do not occupy a permanent position. The river deposits them in one year, very often to be destroyed later, and redeposits them in the next rainy season. The process of bank and deposit erosion together with redeposition has been going on continuously,[2] making it difficult to precisely demarcate the boundary between the districts of Sirajganj and Pabna on one side and the districts of Mymensingh, Tangail and Dhaka on the other. The breaking of a char or the emergence of a new one is also a cause of much violence and litigation. The confluence of the Jamuna and the Padma rivers is unusually unstable and has been shown to have migrated southeast by over fourteen kilometres between 1972 and 2014.
