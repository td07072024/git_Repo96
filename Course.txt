In Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the Teesta River (or Tista), which is one of its largest tributaries.

James Rennell made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps, Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches â€” Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya, etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda river, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo. The Hoorsagar river is still in existence, being the combined outfall of the Baral, a spill channel of the Ganges, the Atrai, the Jamuna or Jamuneswari (not the main Jamuna through which the Brahmaputra now flows), and the Karatoya, but instead of falling into the Ganges, it falls into the main Jamuna, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Padma at Goalundo.
