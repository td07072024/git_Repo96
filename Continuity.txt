In the past the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts. The river flowed east of Dhaka and the old course is now called Old Brahmaputra River.[5][6] The huge earthquake on 2 April 1762 of estimated magnitude 8 on the moment magnitude scale caused tectonic uplift of the Madhupur tract.[7] The main channel of the Brahmaputra at Bhahadurabad point was switched southwards and opened as Jamuna due to the result of caused tectonic uplift of the Madhupur tract. The earthquake caused both uplift and subsidence that resulted in change in course of the Brahmaputra River to from east of Dhaka (Old Brahmaputra River) to 150 kilometres (93 mi) to the west via the Jamuna River. The old course can be seen on https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169555X21001045-ga1_lrg.jpg.

The Jamuna is a very wide river. During the rainy season it stretches about 8–13 km (5–8 mi) from bank to bank. Even during the dry season when the waters subside, the breadth is seldom less than 3–5 km (2–3 mi).
